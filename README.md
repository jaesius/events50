Event Managaement App for MDC Idea Center

This is is the part of a project that I'm using to further my knowledge of C#, Xamarin Forms, and Xaml after taking the Miami Dade College
CS50xMiami course. In the end I hope for it be a robust events management app that keeps users informed in upcomming events at the Idea Center
at Miami Dade College and then to pair it with a ASP.NET admin system to upload and manage events and users.
